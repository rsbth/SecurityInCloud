Cloud Computing has become an area of importance with increased applications in many software companies by offering many benefits in terms of low cost and data accessibility. However, there are still many challenges in solving these security issues in handling data. Therefore, security issues still remain the primary inhibitor to adoption of Cloud Computing services.  The main objective of our research is to  improve  the quality of an existing framework in data security model. In this article, we strive to achieve the above goals with the help of a survey.
On conducting a survey, We identified the hypothesis behind these issues and provide support for future research on Data security issue in cloud computing.
