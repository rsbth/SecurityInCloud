\section{Review Question}
Q1.How can contract signing be made fair, optimistic and abuse-free for any number of signers ?
\\
\\This research question is framed for acquiring  knowlegde on studying the current state of art in abuse-free optimistic contract signing protocols. Contract signing has many applications in secuity and hence, it is very important to have a basic understanding of the contract signing mechanisms. The steps followed, actions taken and trust mechanisms are gathered from the exising studies.    
\\
\\Q2.Can we respect the RSA standard with a contract signing ?\\
\\
RSA is today the industry standard concerning cryptography. This question is aimed at verifying that state of the art contract signing is compatible with this technology and if not, what are the best results achieved with it.
