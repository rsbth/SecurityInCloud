\section{Background and Motivation}

The focus on cloud computing was a obtained when the search was made related to latest technologies. Many of the results shown to us was related to Cloud Computing and effects of security in cloud. Later we gained some knowledge in Cloud Computing and found that security was the major problem in the cloud then our focus was shifted to how to save the data in cloud. Then we have studied about the security models in the Cloud Computing.

Initially a reviews was assist to know importance of am ligating Cloud and security, then later we have planned to target on improvement in the security. Cloud is having a feature called parallel computing which allows to store lager amount of data. Cloud is basically on the remote servers which can have large measure of data for which the security issues are more.

 The Author of (Data security issues) has conducted a survey on problems that the cloud is facing in the security and privacy which helps the future developers in building a better security system.
The previous Authors said that use of cloud has rapidly increased, even though it has a wide range of market there is a lack in providing the security. Customers does not want to lose their private information as a result of malicious insider in the cloud.
